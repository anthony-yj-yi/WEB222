                <h1>History of UNO</h1>
                <p>
                    Uno was developed by Marie Robbins, a barber from Reading, Ohio in 1971. As the game grew in popularity, he started
                    selling copies at his barbershop. It then was sold from other local businesses before Robbins sold the rights to a
                    group of friends who founded International Games, Inc. to sell UNO. International Games was later acquired by
                    Mattel Games in 1992.

                <h1>How to play UNO</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li>Shuffle the deck and deal 7 cards to each player.</li>
                    <li>Place the remaining deck face down in the center creating the draw pile.</li>
                    <li>Turn over the top card face up to create the discard pile.</li>
                    <li>Each player plays a card during their turn that matches the color, number, or symbol of the top card in the discard 
                        pile. If a player does not play a card from their hand, they draw a card from the draw pile.</li>
                    <li>Follow action cards whenever they are played.
                        <ul>
                            <li>A skip card skips the next player's turn.</li>
                            <li>A reverse card skips the direction (clockwise vs counterclockwise) of the play order.<br>
                                Note: It also works as a skip when tehre are only two palyers.
                            </li>
                            <li>Draw cards force the player after to draw numbers equal to the number specified on the card.</li>
                            <li>Wild cards allow the player to switch the colour of the discard pile in play.<br>
                                Note: The plus 4 wild card acts as both a draw card and a wild card.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>When down to the last card, the player must declare "UNO". If another player calls out not saying "UNO".
                        The original player must draw 2 cards as penalty.</li>
                    <li>After playing the last card, that player is out and the game is continued until one player remains.</li>
                </ol>

                    <li>Reserve wild cards for emergencies. Depending on the situation, it may be worthwhile to draw a card instead.</li>
